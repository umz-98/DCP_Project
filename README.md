# Data collection pipeline project

## Milestone 1 - (Make sure to include your reasoning for choosing your website, the technologies you've used etc.)

- In this millstone a scraper class was created which includes the necessary methods to navigate the website such as: accept cookies and search. Furthermore, the scraper class also includes additional methods that could be of use e.g. scrolling the webpage and going to next webpage on a product list.

### Website

- The initial thought in selecting the website was to look at my personal interests. When shortlisting the websites, a list was created which included: JD sports, Netflix and PlayStation store. Out of them I was least engaged with the PlayStation store website since I havenâ€™t been playing much lately. For that reason, I was left with JD and Netflix. I thought about the data that could be used to provide business value to them and had a much clearer image for JD. For that reason, I decided to go with this website. 

### Technologies

- Selenium allows for the control of web browsers, therefore was utilized to scrape the JD website. The information can be scraped using a code and interpreted with pandas making analysis much clearer. Below the code used to present data using pandas:

```python
"""pd.DataFrame()"""
```
